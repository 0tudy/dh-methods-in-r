I welcome your contributions to this project. Please feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:lincoln@lincolnmullen.com) with questions or with suggestions for additional content.

If you spot a typo, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull request. If you've never done this before, the process is very easy: 

* Click the edit this page on the sidebar

* Make the changes using github's in-page editor and save.

* Submit a pull request and include a brief description * of your changes.
"Fixing typos" is perfectly adequate.

* If you make significant changes, please include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution to Lincoln Mullen" - I need this so I can eventually submit the book for publication.
