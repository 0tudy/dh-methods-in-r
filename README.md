# Digital History Methods in R

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lmullen/dh-methods-in-r.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lmullen/dh-methods-in-r)

This repository contains sketches towards a potential book manuscript about applying digital history methods in R, which I am working on in conjunction with a [class I'm teaching on programming for historians](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/). Maybe something will come of it, maybe not. 

Here is the [version of the book manuscript that you can read](http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com); it is automatically generated from this repository.
