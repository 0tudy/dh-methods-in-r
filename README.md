# Digital History Methods in R

This repository contains sketches towards a potential book manuscript about applying digital history methods in R, which I am working on in conjunction with a [class I'm teaching on programming for historians](http://lincolnmullen.com/courses/clio3.2014/). Maybe something will come of it, maybe not. 

Here is [version of the book ms that you can read](http://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com).
